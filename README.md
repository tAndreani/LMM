# LMM
Linear mixed model to compare the source of variability of two factors:
the purpose of this script is to calculate the variability inside a dataset. Lets say you have two quantification methods to compare. The variability among the two dataset can be explained by the method used to quantify your samples or can be explained by the samples. So with this script it is possible to discriminate which factor explain better the variability.
